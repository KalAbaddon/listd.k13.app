    -   step: 17. STARTER GENERATOR – ON 
    -   step: 18. BATTERY – ON 
    -   step: 19. LOW RPMSWITCH – OFF (AFT - YOUR EARS WILL THANK ME LATER) 
    -   step: 20. OPTIONAL - GPU (GROUND POWER UNIT) ON 
    -   step: 21. FIRE WARNING INDICATOR LIGHT – TEST 
    -   step: 22. CAUTION/WARNINGLIGHTS – TEST & RESET 
    -   step: 23. SYSTEM INSTRUMENTS – CHECK 
    -   step: 24. ARMAMENT & COUNTERMEASURE (DISP) PANEL – CHECK (EVERYTHING OFF/SAFE + JETTISON SWITCH IS DOWN & COVERED BY RED COVER SWITCH) 
    -   step: 25. GOV SWITCH – AUTO (FWD) 
    -   step: 26. DE-ICE SWITCH – OFF (AFT)

    -   step: 29. CHIPDET – BOTH (FWD) ANDRIGHT CLICK ON IFF TRANSPONDER MASTER SWITCH (STBY).
    -   step: 30. CHECK FLIGHT CONTROL RESPONSE TO CYCLIC/COLLECTIVE/RUDDER INPUT 
    -   step: '31. SET ALTIMETER TO AIRFIELD ELEVATION (QNH SETTING) (SEE PART 4: PRE-FLIGHT FOR MORE DETAILS)' 
    -   step: 32. SET THROTTLE TO IDLE-START POSITION <br />a) “IDLE RELEASE” SWITCH PRESSED DOWN. SAFETY GATE IS OFF AND YOU ARE NOT PREVENTED FROM SHUTTINGDOWN YOUR ENGINE. <br />b) USE “PAGE UP” TO THROTTLE ALL THE WAY TO FULLY OPEN (LEFT) <br />c) USE “PAGE DOWN” TO THROTTLE BACK TO THE “START” POSITION. YOU WILL KNOW YOU HAVE REACHED THIS POSITION WHEN THE “IDLE RELEASE” SWITCHPOPS UP. <br />d) “IDLE RELEASE” SWITCH SHOULD BE RELEASED (UP).

    -   step: 39. GROUND POWER UNIT (GPU) DISCONNECT IF USING GROUND POWER 
    -   step: 40. CHECK FOR CORRECT AC (112-118 V) AND DC (27-28.5 V) SETTINGS 
    -   step: 41. TURN ON RADAR ALTIMETER (OVERHEAD PANEL) <br />a) Turn on radar altimeterpower switch <br />b) Rotate left knob to activate radar altimeter <br />c) Click rightknob test switch <br />d) Rotate left and right knobs to set the LOW and HIGH radar altimeterwarningswith the flags.
