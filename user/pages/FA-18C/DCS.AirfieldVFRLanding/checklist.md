checklist:
    -   step: Call up the air-to-air RADAR page on your right DDI and HUD repeater on your left DDI. 
    -   step: Enter Navigation master mode and set the Master Arm Switch to SAFE on the |LEFT INSTRUMENT PANEL| and approach at 350 knots and 800 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) along the heading of the landing runway and offset yourself slightly away from your first turn into the pattern.  
    -   step: Five to ten seconds after your wingtip passes the end of the runway (the greater the time, the more time you have to establish your on-speed AoA on the downwind leg), turn into the downwind leg of the landing pattern. Generally, pull 1% of your airspeed in G. For example- 350 knots would equal 3.5 G. Roll out on a reciprocal landing heading and an altitude of 600 feet AGL. 
    -   step: Your lateral offset from the runway should be about 1.2 miles. 
    -   step: Once your airspeed is below 250 knots, lower your landing gear and place your flaps in the FULL down position. |LEFT QUARTER PANEL| 
    -   step: Allow your airspeed to decay until you reach your on-speed angle of attack as indicated left of the HUD on the Angle of Attack Indexer. This will equate to 8.1 degrees of angle of attack which will appear as the yellow circle on the AoA Indexer. On the HUD, the Velocity Vector should be centered in the AoA “E” Bracket. Establish your on-speed AoA at 600 feet AGL. 
    -   step: You will need to trim the aircraft to 8.1 degrees to be hands-free. 
    -   step: Turn into the landing base leg when your wing tip aligns with the runway threshold while maintaining on-speed AoA. Your bank angle should be 30 degrees and the HUD velocity vector should be just below the HUD horizon line. You will need to slightly increase throttle to maintain this AoA. Continue the onspeed descending turn until you are aligned with runway landing heading (a good idea is to set your course line to the landing airfield along the landing runway heading). 
    -   step: Maintain on-speed AoA with the HUD velocity vector placed 500 feet past the runway threshold. Use your throttle to maintain a 3-degree flight path. 
    -   step: At touchdown, reduce the throttles to idle and use small rudder corrections to stay aligned down the runway roll-out.

## Airfield VFR Landing 

===

Being aircraft carrier capable aircraft, the Hornet can land on both “the boat” and airfields. Both landing patterns are quite similar. For this guide though, we will just review the procedure for landing at an airfield under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions.
