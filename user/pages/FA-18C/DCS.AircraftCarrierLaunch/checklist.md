checklist:
    -   step: 1. Set throttles to military power and wipe the controls by moving control stick in a full circle and then push full forward and back. Then, push both full left and right rudder. 
    -   step: 2. Increase throttle to 100% afterburner and move hand off stick. 
    -   step: 3. The catapult will then launch you and place you at flyaway trim. 
    -   step: 4. After positive climb rate has been established, raise the landing gear [G] and set flaps to AUTO [F]. 
    -   step: 5. If launching from catapult 1 or 2 (bow catapults), perform a clearing turn to the right and then proceed parallel along the carrier BRC for 7 miles at no more than 500 feet / 350 knots. If launching from catapult 3 or 4 (waist catapults), perform the clearing turn to the left. 
    -   step: 6. Set right DDI to the A/A attack radar display.
