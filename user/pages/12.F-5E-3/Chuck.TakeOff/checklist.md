checklist:
    -   step: 1. Taxi the aircraft by throttling up to 85 % RPM. 
    -   step: 2. Steer the aircraft by HOLDING the Nose Wheel Steering button (“S” key binding) as you turn using the rudder pedals. 
    -   step: 3. Ensure you align yourself with the runway and advance a couple of yards to keep your nose wheel straight and aligned. 
    -   step: 4. Set Radar MODE switch to STBY. 
    -   step: 5. On HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator), set course to the takeoff runway heading (088) by adjusting course with the CRS knob. 
    -   step: 6. Set NOSE STRUT switch to EXTEND to gain an additional 3 degrees of  Angle of Attack, minimizing the runway length required for takeoff. 
    -   step: 7. Set flaps to AUTO and ensure airbrakes are retracted. 
    -   step: 8. Hold down brakes, increase throttle to 95 % RPM. 
    -   step: 9. Release brakes and start rolling. 
    -   step: 10. As the aircraft gains speed, set throttle fully forward to engage afterburners. 
    -   step: 11. Rotate at the required rotation speed obtained from the takeoff performance (145 kts for a “no guns, no missiles” configuration) by gently pulling the stick aft. 
    -   step: 12. Raise landing Gear.
