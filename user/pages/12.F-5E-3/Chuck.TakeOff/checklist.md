checklist:
    -   step: NORMAL ENMGINE START
    -   step: 1. Battery – ON (UP) 
    -   step: 2. Left and Right Generators – ON (UP) 
    -   step: 3. Left and Right BoosterPump– ON (UP) 
    -   step: '4. Connect compressedair supply unit: <br />a) Press “\” to open radio menu <br />b) Press “F8” to select ground crew <br />c) Press “F5” to select Ground air supply <br />d) Press “F1” to connect air supply unit '
    -   step: 5. Give a command to supply air for left engine motoring <br />a) Press “\” to open radio menu <br />b) Press “F8” to select ground crew <br />c) Press “F5” to select Ground air supply <br />d) Press “F3” to supply air (apply) 
    -   step: 6. Once left engine RPM has reached at least 10 %, push the LEFT ENGINE START button. 
    -   step: '7. Set left engine throttle to IDLE by pressing “RALT+HOME”. [Control: Throttle (LEFT) – IDLE)] '
    -   step: '8. Within 35 seconds, left engine will stabilize to the following parameters: <br />a) IDLE RPM (49-52 %) <br />b) EGT no less than 140 deg C <br />c) Nozzle position 60 to 79% <br />d) Fuel flow rate about 400 pph <br />e) Oil pressure between 5 and 20 psi <br />f) UTILITY hydraulic pressure between 2800 and 3200 psi <br />g) Auxiliary intake door position set to BARBER POLE (left intake door open, right door closed) '
    -   step: 9. Give a command to supply air for right engine motoring <br />a) Press “\” to open radio menu <br />b) Press “F8” to select ground crew <br />c) Press “F5” to select Ground air supply <br />d) Press “F3” to supply air (apply) 
    -   step: 10. Once right engine RPM has reached at least 10 %, push the RIGHT ENGINE START button. 
    -   step: '11. Set right engine throttle to IDLE by pressing “RSHIFT+HOME”. [Control: Throttle (RIGHT) – IDLE)] '
    -   step: 12. Within 35 seconds, right engine will stabilize to IDLE parameters as shown in step 8). The Auxiliary intake door position will be then set to OPEN (both intake doors are open).
    -   step: AIRCRAFT PREPARATION
    -   step: '13. Disconnectcompressedair supply unit: <br />a) Press “\” to open radio menu <br />b) Press “F8” to select ground crew <br />c) Press “F5” to select Ground air supply <br />d) Press “F2” to disconnectair supply unit '
    -   step: '14. Set radar MODE switch to STBY. <br />• Caution: Radar will proceed to a warm-up phase. Radar can overheat after more than 10 minutes spent on the ground. Make sure you are taking off in less than 10 minutes or simply set the radar MODE switch to OFF and set it back to STBY before takeoff (recommended). '
    -   step: 15. Retract airbrakes by setting airbrake thumb switch FWD 
    -   step: 16. Set flap mode to THUMB SWITCH (MIDDLE POSITION) 
    -   step: 17. Set flap thumb switch AFT (AUTO) 
    -   step: 18. Enable Yaw and Pitch Dampers (FWD) 
    -   step: 19. Close canopy (Lever FWD) 
    -   step: 20. Set OXYGEN SUPPLY switch to ON (FWD) 
    -   step: 21. Set PITCH TRIM for Takeoff using elevator trimmer switch [RCTRL+. And RCTRL+;] on your stick. It will vary with your takeoff configuration.
    -   step: 22. Set Altimeter’s pressure altitude to 0 using by rotating the TEST knob. 
    -   step: 23. Set Standby Attitude Indicator pitch trim to -3 deg as shown by rotating the PULL TO CAGE knob. 
    -   step: 24. Set Primary Attitude Indicator pitch trim to -3 deg as shown by rotating its pitch trim knob. 
    -   step: 25. Set PITOT HEAT and ENGINE ANTI-ICE switches ON (UP) 
    -   step: '26. Remove Wheel Chocks by pressing: <br />a) “/” <br />b) “F8 – GROUND CREW” <br />c) “F4 – WHEEL CHOCKS” <br />d) ”F2 – REMOVE” '
    -   step: 27. Press MASTER CAUTION light to reset it. 
    -   step: 28. Press the RWS (Radar Warning System) POWER button and the RWS SEARCH button.
    -   step: 29. The right fuel tank has about 580 lbs more fuel than the left fuel tank for a fully fueled aircraft without drop tanks. Depending on your fuel state during flight, it is important to have a balanced fuel state. <br />• Set AUTO-BALANCE switch to LEFT LOW. AUTO-BALANCE switch will automatically revert to MIDDLE position once fuel configuration is balanced. 
    -   step: 30. Consult takeoff performance table below to obtain your rotation speed. For a “no guns, no missiles” configuration, our rotation speed will be about 145 kts. 
    -   step: 31. Set throttle to 85 % RPM and start taxiing.
