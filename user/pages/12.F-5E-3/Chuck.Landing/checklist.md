checklist:
    -   step: 1. Start approach 3 nm from airport @ 1500 ft and 300 kts 
    -   step: 2. Start reverse landing course @ 1500 ft and 300 kts 
    -   step: 3. Set flap thumb switch to AUTO 
    -   step: 4. Extend landing gear 
    -   step: 5. Ensure green lights indicate landing is on downlock 
    -   step: 6. Decelerate to 165 kts while maintaining 1500 ft. Use airbrakes if necessary. 
    -   step: 7. Carry out turning to the landing course @ 1500 ft and 165 kts 
    -   step: 8. Descend at a rate of 1000 ft/min  and slow down to a final approach speed of 145 kts.
    -   step: 9. On final, decrease vertical speed to 400 ft/min. Flare at 20 ft by gently pulling the stick aft and touchdown at 135 kts. 
    -   step: "APPROACH SPEED FORMULA: <br />VAPPROACH = 145 + 5 (if gun ammo remaining) + (fuel qty remaining – 1000)/200 Example for approach with 3000 lbs remaining with gun ammo <br />VAPP = 145 + 5 + (3000 - 1000)/200 = 160 kts Example for approach with 600 lbs remaining without gun ammo <br />VAPP = 145 + 0 + (600 - 1000)/200 = 143 kts"
    -   step: '10. Slowly lower the nose wheel and deploy drag chute by pulling the chute handle. (shortcut: “P”) Tap your toe brakes until you come to a full stop.'
