checklist:
    -   step: 1) Turn ON (UP) weapon system switches (in black) on armament panel.
    -   step: 2) Set Air/Ground Mode switch to GROUND.
    -   step: '3) Select desired rocket salvo quantity (example: we choose “8” on the inner scale, which means that each time we press the weapons release button we sent a volley of 8 rockets coming from ALL pods).'
    -   step: 4) Turn ON ASP gunsight pipper and fixed net.
    -   step: 5) Set ASP gunsight to LNC (Missile & Rocket = DOWN), S (shooting mode = UP), AUT (automatic = UP) and GYRO (ASP GYRO mode = DOWN).
    -   step: 6) Set target wingspan (size) to 10 m.
    -   step: 7) Cut throttle (IDLE) and enter a 30 deg dive from 3,000 m minimum.
    -   step: '8) Put pipper on target and monitor bottom range band: fire from 1,700 m by holding the WEAPONS RELEASE button. You will have a visual cue when the LAUNCH ALLOWED light is lit up.'
