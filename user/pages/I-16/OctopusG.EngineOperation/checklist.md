checklist:
    -   step: • Do not let CHT drop below than 120*С during flights. It leads to increase of engine acceleration time and engine work instability.
    -   step: • Do not exceed  235*С CHT during TO power more than 5 min. Do not exceed  235*С CHT during other power settings more than 15 min.
    -   step: • Do not exceed 85*С oil temperature more than 3 min (normal range is  60-75*С).
    -   step: • Do not allow propeller overspeeding 2350 rpm more than 30 sec, 2300 rpm more than 4 min.
    -   step: • Do not exceed 5 minutes using WEP settings of manifold pressure.
    -   step: '• WEP: manifold pressure is higher than 910 mmHg and rpm is 2300.'
    -   step: • During flight higher than 3000 m. use the second speed of engine supercharger.
