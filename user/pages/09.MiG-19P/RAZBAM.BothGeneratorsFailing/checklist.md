checklist:
    -   step: 1. Contact the ATC/Control Tower and immediately return to land at your Airbase. 
    -   step: 2. Turn off all Electric consumer power switches. This includes both DC Generators (ГЕНЕРАТОР ЛЕВЫЙ, ГЕНЕРАТОР ПРАВЫЙ) RP-5 Radar (ИЗУМРУД), RV-5 Radar Altimeter (МАРКЕР РВ), RSIU-4V Radio (РАЦИЯ РАСХОДОМ), SRO-2 IFF, ARK-5P (АВАРИЙН АРК РАЦИЯ) Radio Navigation System and all Fuel Tank Pumps (НАСОС 1., 2., 3. & 4. ГО БАКА) (if flying above 7,000 meters, keep the Fuel Tank Pump 1 (НАСОС 1. ГО БАКА) ON. 
    -   step: 3. Turn the Radio Power ON (РАЦИЯ РАСХОДОМ) only when it is necessary to communicate with the Airbase Tower in order to conserve power. 
    -   step: 4. Engine Throttle movement should be slow. On Landing Approach, deploy both the Landing Gear and Flaps using the Emergency Procedures. 
    -   step: 5. The safe time the Batteries can last powering the systems is- <br />8 minutes, if the Engines were started using the Batteries. <br />12 minutes, if the Engines were started using Ground Power. <br />If all the consumers are left ON- <br /> 3 minutes, if the engines were started using the batteries. <br /> 7 minutes, if the engines were started using ground power."
