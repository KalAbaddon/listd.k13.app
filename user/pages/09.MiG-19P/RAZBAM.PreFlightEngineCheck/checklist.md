checklist:
    -   step: 1) Ensure that the Ground Crew have installed the wheel chocks.
    -   step: 2) Increase the thrust on both engines to 10,000 RPM for around 40 seconds to warm up the engines.

    -   step: NOTE  When testing the Engines on the Ramp, it is only permitted to increase the thrust at the same time on both Engines to a limit of 10,000 RPM.<br />When doing the following tests, the Engines are tested in turns. During all the Engine Tests the Pilot must be aware of any Vibrations and Oscillations of the Engines or Tachometer Indications and any sudden EGT rise.
    -   step: 3) Connect the Nose Gear Brake and increase the RPM to the Nominal Position.<br />The Tachometer should indicate 11,150+50 RPM.<br />Engine EGT should be less than 550 oC.<br />The Oil Pressure Warning Lamps should remain Off.
    -   step: 4) Operate the Throttle to the Military Power Position.<br />The Tachometer should indicate 11,150+50 RPM.<br />Engine EGT should be less than 650oC.<br />Both the Green Military Power Lamps should illuminate.<br />The Oil Pressure Warning Lamps should remain Off.
    -   step: 5) To check the Afterburner function, operate the Afterburner Button on the Throttle Quadrant and take a single engine at a time to the Afterburner Regime Position.<br />The “Afterburner” Lamp for the respective Engine should turn illuminate.<br />The Engine EGT temperature should remain below 680 oC.
    -   step: WARNING  The Afterburner Test should not exceed the limit of 10 seconds per Engine.
    -   step: 6) You can check the Power Responsiveness of the Engines by moving the throttles from Idle to the Military Power Position within 1.2-2 seconds.<br />During this test the EGT increase up to 750 oC and the RPM can rise to 11,600 for a short period of time (3-5 seconds).<br />After this, the EGT should stabilize under 650 oC and the RPM at 11,150+50.<br />Check the Engine Description above to check the correct power response time.
