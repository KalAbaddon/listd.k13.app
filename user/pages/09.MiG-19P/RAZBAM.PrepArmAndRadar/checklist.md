checklist:
    -   step: 1) Turn On the “Sight Heating” Switch. While the ASP-5 Gunsight and AR-18-8 Radar Sight indications appear instantly, the Sight Heating assures correct sight operation at Low Temperatures.
    -   step: 2) Turn On the “Sight” Switch. The Yellow Circle with the Center Dot Cannon Aiming Point should appear on the Glass of the ASP-5N Gunsight.
    -   step: 3) Turn On the “Izumrud” Switch. The RP-5 “Izumrud” radar should take 2-3 minutes to warm up and be ready for use.
    -   step: 4) Turn On the “O-57K” Power Switch.
    -   step: 5) Turn On both “Left” And “Right” Cannon Power Switches.
