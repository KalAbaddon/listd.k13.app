    -   step: 2. Increase the Throttle setting to the MILITARY POWER (МАКСИМАЛ) position and check if the lamp remains illuminated. 
    -   step: 3. If the lamp remains illuminated for greater than 15 seconds, carry out a manual engine shutdown, by placing the respective throttle into the STOP (СТОП) position, and carry out an expedited return to the airbase.
    -   step: 4. In case of a Double Engine OIL low pressure warning, return to the airbase if possible or search for place to land or eject as required.
