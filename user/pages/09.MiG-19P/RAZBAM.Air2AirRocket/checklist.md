## Unguided Rockets for Air Combat

===

The ARS-57M Unguided Rockets can be used to attack Large Aircraft, like bombers, where they could be more effective than Cannons. The method of employment is the same as the Cannon, while using the Optical method or the Radar one. When the ASP-5N Armament Mode is changed to Rocket Pods, the Ballistic Data entered for calculations will be that of the ARS-57M Rockets. The Sight will display the correct impact point.
