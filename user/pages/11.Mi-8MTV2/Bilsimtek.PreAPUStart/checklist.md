checklist:
    -   step: Connection of power supplies 
    -   step: 'A. Turning on the batteries:'
    -   step: '"АККУМУЛ. I" и "II" (BATT I, II) to "ВКЛ." (ON (up)) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [1..2];'
    -   step: check the voltage of the battery bus by setting the DC selector knob to "ШИНЫ АКК." (BATT BUS). The voltage should be no less than 24 V.
    -   step: 'check the condition of the batteries as follows: '
    -   step: 'a) "АЭРОДР. ПИТАН." (EXT PWR (external power)) selector to "ВЫКЛ." (OFF) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [7]; '
    -   step: 'b) DC selector knob to "АККУМУЛ. I" (BATT I) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [9..0] '
    -   step: 'c) "АККУМУЛ. II" (BATT II) to "ВЫКЛ" (OFF (down)) [LCtrl] + [LShift +2] '
    -   step: 'd) any fuel boost pump to ON and check Volts (no less than 24 V) [RShift] + [1] '
    -   step: 'e) DC selector knob to "АККУМУЛ. II" (BATT II) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [9..0] '
    -   step: 'f) АККУМУЛ. II" (BATT II) to "ВКЛ" (ON (up)) [LCtrl] + [LShift +2] and "АККУМУЛ. I" (BATT I) to "ВЫКЛ" (OFF (down)) [LCtrl] + [LShift +1] Check voltage (no less than 24 V). '
    -   step: 'g) fuel boost pump to OFF [RShift] + [1]; '
    -   step: 'h) "АККУМУЛ. I" и "II" (BATT I, II) to "ВКЛ." (ON (up)) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [1..2]; '
    -   step: 'i) DC selector knob to "ШИНЫ АКК." (BATT BUS) [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [9..0]. '
    -   step: 'B. Connecting to external electrical power: '
    -   step: 'To connect to an external power source on the ground:'
    -   step: 'DC EXTERNAL POWER : once the "АЭР. ПИТ. ВКЛЮЧЕНО" (EXT PWR ON) light illuminates, then [LCtrl] + [LShift] + [7], check the DC ground power source voltage by setting the DC selector knob to "АЭРОДРОМ. ПИТАН." (EXT PWR). The voltage should be within the limits of 27 - 29 V.'
    -   step: 'AC EXTERNAL POWER (in DCS this occurs simultaneously with the DC power supply): once the "АЭР. ПИТ. ВКЛЮЧЕНО" (EXT PWR ON) light illuminates (after successful connection to an external power source), then [LAlt] + [LShift] + [`], check the ground power source voltage by setting the AC selector knob to "АЭРОДРОМ. ПИТАН." (EXT PWR). The voltage should be within the limits of 200 – 205 V. Set the "АЭРОДРОМ. ПИТАН." (EXT PWR) switch to "ВКЛ." (ON). Set the "ПО-500А ~ 115" (Inverter 1) and "ПТ-200 ~ 36" (Inverter 2) switches to the "АВТОМАТ" (AUTO) (down) postion. Set the "ВЫПРЯМИТЕЛИ I, II, III" (RECTIFIERS 1, 2, 3) to the "ВКЛ." (ON) (up) position. Check the rectifier bus voltage by setting the DC selector knob to "ШИНЫ ВЫПР." (RECT BUSES). The voltage should be within the limits of 27 - 29 V.' 
    -   step: 'o set the AC selector knob to the "~115" position. The voltage should be 115 V.'
    -   step: 'o Set the "АЭРОДР. ПИТАН." (EXT PWR) switch to "ВКЛ." (ON) and the Inverter 115 switch to "РУЧНОЕ" (MAN).'
    -   step: 'o Check the inverter output voltage by setting the AC selector knob to "~115". The voltage should be 115 V. '
    -   step: Equipment preparation and che ck procedures, continued
    -   step: switch ON all the circuit-breakers and switches required for starting the APU and main engines (the starting system, ignition systems for the APU and main engines, fire protection system, hydraulic systems, trim actuators, fuel tank pumps, fuel quantity gauge, engine anti-icing system, friction clutch, electric clutch, gyro correction cutout switch, attitude indicator, directional gyro, autopilot, voice warning system, tail rotor pitch limit system, cockpit voice recorder, anti-collision light [RCTRL] + [RSHIFT] + [1... 9]
    -   step: make sure the AC generator switches are set to "ВЫКЛЮЧЕНО" (OFF) (down) [LAlt] + [LShift] + [1..2]
    -   step: make sure that РИ-65 (RI-65) switch is in the ВЫКЛ. (OFF) position and the corresponding light panel ВКЛЮЧИ РИ-65 (ENABLE RI-65) is on;
    -   step: make sure that the СПУУ-52 (SPUU-52) switch is in the ВЫКЛ. (OFF) position and the corresponding red light-button on the center console is on;
    -   step: check that helicopter has enough fuel, using fuel meter, after check procedure, set the switch to the "РАСХ." (FEED TANK) position (player must take the co-pilot seat) [RCtrl] + [RShift] + [V] rotation clockwise,  [RCtrl] + [RShift] + [B] rotation counterclockwise;
    -   step: check that squibs of the fire extinguishers and fire signalization system are operational according to the procedure described in the chapter 7.6.3 
    -   step: 'For night time operations:'
    -   step: flashlight [LAlt] + [L] (mouse control)
    -   step: turn on red lighting of the instrument and control panels according 7.8.2
    -   step: turn on the navigation lights [RCtrl] + [1..2] (dimmed), the MSL-3 flasher [RCtrl] + [6] and rotor tip lights [RCtrl] + [5] (they must be turned on for safety of the ground crew, in game it is not necessary).

## Preparation and equipment check procedures preceding APU start

===
  
The power supply is required to start the APU. APU start can be made with or using batteries (A), or an external power supply (B).

While performing complete preparation procedure, one must connect power sources and continue extensive control and preparation of equipment for start.
