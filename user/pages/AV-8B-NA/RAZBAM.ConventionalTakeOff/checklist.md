checklist:
    -   step: Jetborne/Semi-jetborne Takeoffs 
        details: All jetborne and semi-jetborne takeoffs being with a takeoff procedure and end with an accelerating transition to wingborne flight. The transition point between the takeoff procedure and the accelerating transition procedure begins once the aircraft is off the ground, the wings are level and the vane is centered. At this point, attitude and AOA can be safely increased and the Accelerating Transition can begin. 
    -   step: Aircraft Configuration Check (On Finger Checks)          
    -   step: 1. Nozzle Rotation Airspeed (NRAS) 
        details: SET NSW LIFTOFF SPEED 
    -   step: 2. Pitch Carets (PC) 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 3. STO Stop 
        details: CLEAR
    -   step: 4. Trim 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 5. Flaps 
        details: AUTO
    -   step: 6. Warning/Caution Lights 
        details: OUT         
    -   step: Engine, Water System & Flight Control Check (Two/Five Finger Checks) 
    -   step: 7. Engine 
        details: CHECK <br />a. MPCD (Left or Right) Select ENG <br />b. Accelerate engine from idle to 60%  <br />c. Check acceleration time within limits 35 to 60%  in 2.4 – 3.1 seconds. <br />d. IGV’s 10 to 21o at 60% 
    -   step: 8. Water 
        details: AS REQUIRED <br />a. Place water switch to TO and note RPM rise.  <br />b. Reset RPM to top end of acceleration band.
    -   step: 9. Nozzle/Flaps/Duct Pressure 
        details: CHECK <br />a. Set nozzles momentarily to approximately 50o <br />b. Check flaps at approximately 25o  <br />c. Check duct pressure at approximately 45 PSI  <br />d. Place nozzles to 10o.        
    -   step: Initiate Takeoff 
    -   step: 10. NWS 
        details: ENGAGE 
    -   step: 11. Throttle 
        details: FULL 
    -   step: 12. Brakes 
        details: RELEASE
    -   step: 13. Engine 
        details: CHECK TOP END RPM and Water Flow (if armed) 
    -   step: 14. At nosewheel liftoff speed 
        details: Gradually rotate with aft stick. Guard against overrotation. 
    -   step: 15.  During liftoff ensure wings remain level and center the slideslip vane. 
    -   step: 16. Set attitude 
        details: Witch Hat at the pitch carets.

## Conventional Takeoff (CTO) 

===

The CTO can be used when configuration or environmental conditions preclude use of any other takeoff type (i.e. crosswinds or asymmetric loadings). The CTO is restricted to gross weights that will not cause the wheel/tire limitation speed of 180 KGS (Knots, Ground Speed) to be exceeded on the takeoff roll.
