checklist:
    -   step: Jetborne/Semi-jetborne Takeoffs 
        details: All jetborne and semi-jetborne takeoffs being with a takeoff procedure and end with an accelerating transition to wingborne flight. The transition point between the takeoff procedure and the accelerating transition procedure begins once the aircraft is off the ground, the wings are level and the vane is centered. At this point, attitude and AOA can be safely increased and the Accelerating Transition can begin. 
    -   step: Aircraft Configuration Check (On Finger Checks)          
    -   step: 1. Nozzle Rotation Airspeed (NRAS) 
        details: SET AS CALCULATED 
    -   step: 2. Pitch Carets (PC) 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 3. STO Stop 
        details: SET AS CALCULATED 
    -   step: 4. Trim 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 5. Flaps 
        details: AS DESIRED (STOL or AUTO) 
    -   step: 6. Warning/Caution Lights 
        details: OUT         
    -   step: Engine, Water System & Flight Control Check (Two/Five Finger Checks) 
    -   step: 7. Engine 
        details: CHECK <br />a. MPCD (Left or Right) Select ENG <br />b. Accelerate engine from idle to 60%  <br />c. Check acceleration time within limits 35 to 60%  in 2.4 – 3.1 seconds. <br />d. IGV’s 10 to 21o at 60% 
    -   step: 8. Water 
        details: AS REQUIRED <br />a. Place water switch to TO and note RPM rise.  <br />b. Reset RPM to top end of acceleration band.
    -   step: 9. Nozzle/Flaps/Duct Pressure 
        details: CHECK <br />a. Set nozzles momentarily to STO Stop and check angle <br />b. Check flaps for proper angle based on flap mode <br />c. Check duct pressure at approximately 45 PSI  <br />d. Place nozzles to 10o.        
    -   step: Initiate Takeoff 
    -   step: 10. NWS 
        details: ENGAGE 
    -   step: 11. Throttle 
        details: FULL 
    -   step: 12. Brakes 
        details: RELEASE
    -   step: 13. Engine 
        details: CHECK TOP END RPM and Water Flow (if armed)         
    -   step: 14. Nozzles 
        details: STO STOP AT CALCULATED NRAS 
    -   step: 15. During liftoff ensure wings remain level and center the slideslip vane. 
        details: Hold heading and adjust attitude to prevent fore/aft drift. 
    -   step: 16. Begin transition to wingborne flight.

## Short Takeoff (STO) 

===

The STO can be used for the widest variety of aircraft configuration, weight and runway conditions provided that crosswinds remain within specified limits.
