checklist:
    -   step: WARNING 
        details: During AT, AOA must not exceed 15o. Over-rotation or high rotational rates may result in the AOA rising uncontrollably even with stick full forward. Uncontrollable pitch ups are most likely to occur at extreme aft CG loadings and/or with the wing flaps deflected more than 25o.
    -   step: 1. Throttle 
        details: FULL 
    -   step: 2. Attitude 
        details: SET WITCH HAT AT THE PITCH CARETS Continue to maintain wings level and vane centered. 
    -   step: 3. Nozzles 
        details: GRADUALLY ROTATE THE NOZZLES AFT. <br />Maintain nozzle angle of 25o or greater while in STOL flaps <br />Nozzle rotation should enable the aircraft to maintain a slight climb. 
    -   step: Once wingborne flight is achieved 
    -   step: 4. Reduce power to achieve normal lift dry rating or less and stop water flow (if required). 
    -   step: 5. Perform After Takeoff Check or enter the landing pattern.

## Accelerating Transition (AT) 

===

Accelerating Transition is the term used to describe transition from jetborne/semi-jetborne flight to wingborne flight. The AT begins when the aircraft is clear of ground effect and at an altitude sufficient to avoid obstacles and introduction of FOD onto the landing surface.
