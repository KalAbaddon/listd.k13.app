checklist:
    -   step: Jetborne/Semi-jetborne Takeoffs 
        details: All jetborne and semi-jetborne takeoffs being with a takeoff procedure and end with an accelerating transition to wingborne flight. The transition point between the takeoff procedure and the accelerating transition procedure begins once the aircraft is off the ground, the wings are level and the vane is centered. At this point, attitude and AOA can be safely increased and the Accelerating Transition can begin. 
    -   step: Aircraft Configuration Check (On Finger Checks)          
    -   step: 1. Nozzle Rotation Airspeed (NRAS) 
        details: NOT REQUIRED 
    -   step: 2. Pitch Carets (PC) 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 3. STO Stop 
        details: CLEAR 
    -   step: 4. Trim 
        details: SET 
    -   step: 5. Flaps 
        details: STOL 
    -   step: 6. Warning/Caution Lights 
        details: OUT         
    -   step: Engine, Water System & Flight Control Check (Two/Five Finger Checks) 
    -   step: 7. Engine 
        details: CHECK <br />a. MPCD (Left or Right) Select ENG <br />b. Accelerate engine from idle to 60%  <br />c. Check acceleration time within limits 35 to 60%  in 2.4 – 3.1 seconds. <br />d. IGV’s 10 to 21o at 60% 
    -   step: 8. Water  
        details: AS REQUIRED <br />a. Place water switch to TO and note RPM rise.  <br />b. Reset RPM to top end of acceleration band.
    -   step: 9. Nozzle/Flaps/Duct Pressure 
        details: CHECK <br />a. Set nozzles momentarily to approximate 50o  <br />b. Check flaps at approximately 62o  <br />c. Check duct pressure at approximately 45 PSI  <br />d. Place nozzles at the HOVER Stop and check angle.        
    -   step: Initiate Takeoff 
    -   step: 10. Throttle 
        details: FULL 
    -   step: 11. Brakes 
        details: HOLD until airborne 
    -   step: 12. Engine 
        details: CHECK TOP END RPM and Water Flow (if armed) 
    -   step: 13. During liftoff Ensure wings remain level. 
        details: Hold heading and adjust attitude to prevent fore/aft drift. 
    -   step: 14. When clear of ground effect (20 – 25 feet)
        details: gradually reduce power to establish a hover, or when passing 50 feet and clear of obstacles, being transition to wingborne flight.

## Vertical Takeoff (VTO) 

===

If possible, VTO into the wind. Lateral control during the first few feet of a VTO is critical, do not hesitate to make immediate, large and rapid control movements to counteract bank angles.
