checklist:
    -   step: Approaching 180 
    -   step: 1. Nozzles 
        details: 40 – 60o 
    -   step: 2. Flaps 
        details: Check programming and droop 
    -   step: 3. AOA 
        details: 10 – 12o 
    -   step: Off the 180 
    -   step: 4. Adjust flight path with stick  
    -   step: 5. Control AOA with throttle or nozzles  
    -   step: At the Key 
    -   step: 6. Set attitude 
        details: WITCH HAT ON THE HORIZON 
    -   step: 7. Nozzles 
        details: HOVER STOP 
    -   step: 8. Minimize sideslip
        details: Ensure no more than 15o AOA and strive for 0o AOB until less than 60 knots. Increase power as required to maintain a shallow glideslope (approx. 3o) to arrive abeam the landing site at 150 feet AGL. 
    -   step: At 60 KCAS 
    -   step: 9. Check for adequate performance margin. 
        details: If more than two legs of the power hexagon then execute a wave off.  
    -   step: 10.  Approaching landing site. 
        details: Select ground references and monitor rate of closure. When closure is under control and below 30 knots, cross over the landing site while remaining at 150 feet AGL minimum until over a prepared surface. Flare slightly to spot or use braking stop as required, and establish hover over the desired landing point.

## Decelerating Transition to a Hover 

===

Decelerating transitions for VLs are started from a key position approximately 0.5 NM from the touchdown point (preferably downwind) at an altitude of approximately 310 feet AGL. This places the aircraft on a slightly descending flight path toward a point abeam the intended point of landing at approximately 150 feet AGL. From, or just prior to arrival at, this abeam position the aircraft then crosses to hover directly over the intended point of landing.
