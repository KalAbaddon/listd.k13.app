## Fixed Nozzle Slow Landing (SL)

The SL is used when aircraft gross weight is too high for a VL or RVL or to reduce engine stress. There are two basic types of Slow Landing

The recommended slow landing technique is the Fixed Nozzle Slow Landing using STOL flaps. The use of AUTO flaps is recommended when crosswinds conditions are heavy or when dealing with high asymmetric store loadings.
