checklist:
    -   step: 1. Master mode NAV or LANDN NAV (or P/O) 
    -   step: 2. Confirm selected landing base 
    -   step: 3. Select master mode P/O, and then select LANDN NAV. 
    -   step: 4. LF should be displayed on the destination indicator.
    -   step: On passing LF, no automatic waypoint change occurs, but the course command “locks” in the runway heading. After a 90° turn, a new approach via LB is selected. 
    -   step: The pilot can always select a new approach via LB by setting the master mode selector to NAV, and then to LANDN NAV.
