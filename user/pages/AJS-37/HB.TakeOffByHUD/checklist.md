checklist:
    -   step: 1. Apply brakes 
    -   step: 2. Advance throttle to maximum power without afterburner. 
        details: Check EGT (max 590°C + outside ambient temperature) 
    -   step: 3. Release brakes, steer with pedals 
    -   step: 4. If needed, ignite afterburner. 
        details: Check- <br />a. Zone indicator = desired afterburner zone. <br />b. Exhaust nozzle indicator = desired zone achieved. <br />c. Pressure ratio (EPR)- <br />-Zone 2 <br />---» < +15°C  > 1.9  <br />---» > +15°C  > 1.8 <br />-Zone 3 =  Maximum power
    -   step: 5. Check airspeed indicator and Time / distance line 
    -   step: 6. Rotate with the flight path vector when the time / distance line reaches the markers. 
        details: Set flight path vector to; <br />a. The horizon line when not using the after burner <br />b. To about the height of the outer pillars (about 3° above the horizon) when using the afterburner. 
    -   step: 7. Check the increased airspeed on the airspeed indicator. 
    -   step: 8. Retract the landing gear when airborne. 
    -   step: Note the risk of a decrease in lift as the flaps retract when retracting the landing gear 
    -   step: 9. Climb with selected attitude until the flight path vector appears. The HUD should switch modes automatically between the take-off symbology and the normal navigation mode. 
    -   step: 10. Elevate HUD reflector glass to inflight mode to display HUD symbology when at lower angles of attack.
