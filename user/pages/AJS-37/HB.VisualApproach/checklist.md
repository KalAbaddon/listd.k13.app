checklist:
    -   step: 1. Reduce airspeed to Vi 550 km/h during approach. 
    -   step: 2. Check the backup attitude indicator. Fast erect if needed. 
    -   step: 3. Extend the landing gear. Check landing gear indicator (3 green fields) 
    -   step: 4. Landing light ON (LANDNING) 
    -   step: 5. Preselect thrust reversal if desired. (Please reference the "Thrust reverser use" section on the next pages ahead) 
    -   step: 6. Check brake pressure (200- 270 kp/cm2). 
    -   step: 7. Set HUD reflector to lower setting (landing mode). Set master mode LANDN PAR/ OPT. 
    -   step: 8. Do not fly below an airspeed corresponding to 12° α (AoA). 
    -   step: 9. Turn final during descent with a minimum airspeed corresponding to 12° α (AoA). 
    -   step: 10. Aim for a 3° angle of descent and reduce airspeed to correspond to 12° α (AoA). The line in the HUD during LANDN P/O corresponds to 2.86°. 
    -   step: 11. Place the descent line on the runway threshold and centre the sight dot on the centreline, steer the flight path indicator onto the line. Maintain attitude. Strive for a touchdown at about 100-200 metres in on the runway. 
    -   step: 12. At 15 metres altitude above the runway (30 if not using the radar altimeter), the HUD will change to the descent rate mode. The previous 2.86° line represents the maximum vertical velocity (2.96 m/s). 
    -   step: 13. Thrust reversal (if preselected) will activate once nose wheel is depressed.

## Visual approach 

===

Flight should be planned with at least 10% remaining fuel on touchdown. A normal landing pattern uses about 8% fuel.
