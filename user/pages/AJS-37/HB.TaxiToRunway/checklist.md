checklist:
    -   step: Full deflection of rudder gives a nose wheel rotation of about 30Â°. Turning radius can be reduced by using differential braking.
    -   step: On increasing throttle above ground idle, check that ejector nozzle is closed.
    -   step: Fuel consumption on the ground is about 0.3% per minute.
    -   step: The engine gives a relatively high amount of thrust on idle, which is why taxing on slippery and even on dry surfaces should be done carefully. 
    -   step: Thrust reversal may be used to reduce speed during taxing.
    -   step: In confined areas, thrust reversal may be used to reverse the aircraft.
    -   step: Check that the area is clear behind the aircraft before reversing.
    -   step: Do not reverse if the surface consists of a large amount of particles, such as sand or stone. Use as little thrust as possible.
    -   step: CAUTION- when reversing, do not apply the brakes until the aircraft has come to a complete stop, as this may cause the aircraft to pivot backwards and lead to a tailstrike.
