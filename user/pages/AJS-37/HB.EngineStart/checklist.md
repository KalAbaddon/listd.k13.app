checklist:
    -   step: START SWITCH
        details: ON (TILL) and hold for 2 seconds (switch will be held in place automatically        during the duration of the engine start cycle)
    -   step: Engine Start Check<br />» Indicator light STARTSYS is lit within 5 seconds (if not START SWITCH OFF).<br />» Maximum EGT (exhaust gas temperature) 400° C is not exceeded.<br />» If exceeded. Throttle to OFF, START SWITCH to OFF. Engine is likely faulty.<br />» Checks during ground idle.<br />» RPM- 55-65 %.<br />» Pressure ratio- around 1.0.<br />» Nozzle indicator- Fully open.<br />» Maximum Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)- 350 °C.<br />» Indicator lights- OFF;<br />» OLJETRYCK (oil pressure may be lit maximum of 60 seconds) X-TANK BRÄ (Drop tank fuel).<br />» SPAK-  Automatically turned ON. Check.<br />» If risk for engine icing. Turn engine de-ice (AVISNING MOTOR) ON (TILL).
    -   step: NOTE- Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) should increase within 30 seconds.
        details: Further start-up attempts may not be made if (due to safety concerns)<br />Failed start-up due to exceeded EGT.<br />RPM has increased over 65% without pilot input (possible danger of runaway engine). <br />A maximum of three engine start-up attempts is allowed. At least a minute should elapse between each attempt is started. <br />When the STARTER SWITCH is set to ON (TILL), until the indicator light START-SYST is turned off, the Master Caution system is inhibited.
