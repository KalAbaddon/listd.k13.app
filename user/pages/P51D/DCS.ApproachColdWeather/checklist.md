checklist:
    -   step: Since temperature inversions occur frequently in cold environments, avoid engine overcooling during descents.
    -   step: Use carburetor heat when outside air temperatures are below -12°C (10°F).
    -   step: Turn off all nonessential electrical equipment at least one minute before final approach to reduce battery load when the generator cuts out.
    -   step: Pump the brakes to chip away any accumulated ice.
