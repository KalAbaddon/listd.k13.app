checklist:
    -   step: Slow down to 170 mph before lowering the landing gear.
    -   step: When lowering the landing gear, make sure the control handle is DOWN and locked. Check the landing gear indicator lights. Be sure the hydraulic pressure returns to approximately 1000 PSI. Be prepared for the aircraft to feel nose-heavy when the gear is down. Adjust elevator trim to compensate.
    -   step: Maintain approximately 150 mph IAS in the traffic pattern.
    -   step: Lower the flaps when turning on final approach and the airspeed is below 165 mph IAS.
    -   step: Once lined up on final and with the flaps lowered, maintain approximately 115-120 mph IAS.
    -   step: When sure of a correct landing approach, close the throttle.
    -   step: Just before getting to the runway, break the glide with a controlled flare and approach so as to land within the first third of the runway in a 3-point attitude.
    -   step: Hold the aircraft in the 3-point attitude just above the runway until flying speed is lost and the plane sets down at approximately 90 mph.
    -   step: The tail wheel is locked when the stick is neutral or aft, so steering is limited after touchdown. Keep the stick held back until enough speed is lost and you are ready to turn off the runway and taxi. 
    -   step: Never attempt to push the stick forward and unlock the tail wheel in a turn when taxiing. Release the tail wheel before starting the turn.
