checklist:
    -   step: Advance throttle to Takeoff Power (61 in.Hg at 3000 RPM).
    -   step: Hold the tail down until sufficient speed is attained to ensure positive rudder control. Speed should be slightly greater than for normal takeoff.
    -   step: Apply sufficient aileron control to keep wings level or even to effect a slightly wing-low attitude into the wind.
    -   step: Keep the aircraft firmly on the runway until speed is sufficient to make a smooth, clean break.
    -   step: After becoming airborne, crab into the wind enough to counteract drift.
