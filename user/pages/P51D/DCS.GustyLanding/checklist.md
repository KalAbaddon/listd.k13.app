checklist:
    -   step: In a gusty wind condition, maintain speeds slightly faster than normal to minimize the likelihood of a sudden loss of lift between wind gusts. Watch for the effect of gust on the aircraft. The gust tends to have a ballooning effect. Then, when the gust quits, the aircraft may drop as lift is reduced, resulting in an impact with the ground. 
    -   step: Use about half flaps when performing a landing in gusty conditions.
