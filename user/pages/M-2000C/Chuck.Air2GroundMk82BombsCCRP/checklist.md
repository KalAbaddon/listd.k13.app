checklist:
    -   step: 1. On PPA, set fuze selector to either RET (retardé/delayed fuze) or INST (instantaneous fuze)
    -   step: 2. On PPA, set number of bombs to be released (00 = single)
    -   step: 3. On PPA, set distance between bomb release (02 = 20 m)
    -   step: 4. Adjust seat to see lower part of HUD better.
    -   step: 5. SetMaster Arm switch to ARME (UP)
    -   step: 6. Select BL1 (Bombe Lisse – Low-drag MK-82) on PCA
    -   step: 7. Make sure TASmode is selected on PCA
    -   step: 8. Turn radar power ON (EMISSION)
    -   step: 9. Put diamond on target and press the “MAGIC SLAVE/AG DESIGNATE” button on your HOTAS. Locked target will be marked with a cross.
    -   step: 10. Fly level towards target (make sure you have at least 2000 ft of clearance). Horizontal CCRP line will show up when you are 15 seconds from target.
    -   step: 11. When release cue appears, press and hold WEAPON RELEASE button (SPACE by default) until CCRP line is lined up with the diamond reticle. The bombs will automatically be released. In this example, one bomb will be released per trigger press.
    -   step: 12. Observe damage and unlock target (BACKSPACE by default). Unfortunately, CCRP is not very precise.
