checklist:
    -   step: 1. Adjust seat height
    -   step: 2. Select APPROACH mode on PCA (yellow “S” caution when engaged)
    -   step: 3. Deploy landing gear below 230 kts
    -   step: 4. Keep flight path marker where you want to touchdown
    -   step: 5. Line up flight path marker and acceleration chevrons within the “glide slope” brackets by adjusting throttle and stick.
    -   step: 6. During touchdown, release stick to maintain your Angle of Attack and bleed speed in the process (your delta wing will act as a huge airbrake).
    -   step: 7. Apply brakes when you slowed down under 100 kts and push your nose down.
    -   step: 8. Engage Nosewheel Steering (DIRAV) when you slowed down under 40 kts.
