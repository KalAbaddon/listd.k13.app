checklist:
    -   step: 1) Set weapon selector to “GUNS”. Do it 10 minutes in advance to let the A-4 Gunsight System warm up, then set the Gun Selector to “ALL GUNS”. 
    -   step: 2) Set Target Wingspan to about 30 ft (wingspan of a MiG-15) 
    -   step: 3) Uncage Mechanical Sight before engaging air target 
    -   step: 4) Current max radar range is 1600 ft. Radar light will become red once a target is spotted and it might suffer interference under an altitude of 6000 ft because of ground clutter. Continuous light means continuous radar tracking, while flickering light means that radar is spotting something butnot actively tracking it. 
    -   step: 5) Hold the Electrical Caging switch for a few seconds (gunsight will stop moving) and release it (gunsight will begin tracking). Target range on the range dial will start tracking the target’s range. 
    -   step: 6) When target’s wingspan fits the gunsight, fire on the target (GUN FIRE trigger).
