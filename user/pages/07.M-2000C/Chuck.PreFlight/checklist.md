    -   step: 21. Left and Right Low-Pressure Fuel Pumps (Pompe Basse-Pression Gauche et Droite) – Set to MARCHE (ON)
    -   step: 22. Set starter fuel pump (POMPE DÉMARRAGE) to MARCHE (ON)<br />• Left click on the Ignition switch orange cover to ensure starter fuel pump is ON
    -   step: 23. Press ignition switch and wait for engine to spool up
    -   step: 24. When engine RPM reaches 10 %, move throttle at IDLE position.
    -   step: 25. Once RPM reaches 60%, set starter fuel pump (POMPE DÉMARRAGE) to OFF<br />A) Left click on the Ignition switch orange cover<br />B) Left click on the starter fuel pump switch
    -   step: INS ALIGNMENT PROCESS
    -   step: a) On PSM (Poste Sélecteur de Modes = Mode Selector Panel), set INS mode to ALN (Alignment) to start alignment procedure of inertial systems.
    -   step: b) Open up your kneeboard using “RSHIFT+K” and cycle through pages using the “[“ and “]” (kneeboard previous/next page bindings) to find the PILOT SIGNOUT SHEET and the aircraft’s initial position. 
    -   step: c) In our case, our initial position is 42:52.12 North for Latitude and 041:07.28 East for Longitude, with an airport elevation of 15 meters.
    -   step: d) On PCN (Poste de Commande de Navigation = Navigation Control Panel), set INS parameter selector to L/G.
    -   step: e) Press “1” (+) button on keypad to select Latitude field
    -   step: f) Press “2” (North) button on keypad to select North
    -   step: g) Enter “425212” on keypad and press “INS” (Insert) button to enter the aircraft latitude coordinates (42:52.12 North) as specified on kneeboard. If you made a mistake, press the EFF (Effacer/Erase) button.
    -   step: h) Press “3” (+) button on keypad to select Longitude field
    -   step: i) Press “6” (East) button on keypad to select East
    -   step: j) Enter “0410728” on keypad and press “INS” (Insert) button to enter the aircraft latitude coordinates (041:07.28 East). as specified on kneeboard. If you made a mistake, press the EFF (Effacer/Erase) button.
    -   step: k) On PCN (Poste de Commande de Navigation = Navigation Control Panel), set INS parameter selector to ALT (Altitude).
    -   step: l) Press “1” (+) button two times consecutively on keypad to select Altitude field
    -   step: m) Enter “00015” as the airport elevation (15 meters). Don’t forget to add enough zeroes to have the right data format. Press “INS” (Insert) button to enter the aircraft. If you made a mistake, press the EFF (Effacer/Erase) button.
    -   step: n) Press VAL button to validate data entry of the MIP (Module d’Insertion de Paramètres = Data Cartridge InsertionModule).
    -   step: o) Set INS operation mode to “STS” (Status) to monitor remaining alignment time.<br />• First alignment phase Class 4 (Coarse Alignment) will last 4 minutes.<br />• Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth alignment phases (Precision alignment) will last another 4 minutes.<br />• Total alignment process should take 8 min.
    -   step: p) A yellow ALN (Alignment) caution will blink during the first alignment phase (Class 4, coarse alignment).
    -   step: q) “PRÊT” (Ready) caution will blink when first alignment phase is complete after 4 minutes.
    -   step: r) “PRÊT” (Ready) caution will remain illuminated when all remaining phases are complete after another 4 minutes.
    -   step: s) Set INS operation mode to “N” (Normal) when alignment phase is complete and set INS mode selector to “NAV”. This step can be done right before you start taxiing.
    -   step: NOTE: During the alignment phase, you can enter or modify waypoint entries at the same time.
    -   step: START-UP PROCEDURE CONTINUED
    -   step: 26. VTH/HUD (Heads-Up Display) power switch – MARCHE (ON)
    -   step: 27. VTB/HDD (Heads-Down Display) power switch – MARCHE (ON)
    -   step: 28. Radar Altimeter Power switch - MARCHE (ON)
    -   step: 29. HSI Mode – set to NAV (Cm or Cv as desired)
    -   step: 30. Set countermeasures switch to MANUAL (middle)
    -   step: 31. On ElectronicWarfare (EW) panel, set:<br />• Set EW mode to VEILLE (Standby)<br />• Set Jammer (Brouilleur) to MARCHE (ON)<br />• Set RWR (Détecteur d’Alertes) to MARCHE (ON)<br />• Set MLWS (Détection de Départ de Missile – Missile Launch IR Detector) to MARCHE (ON)<br />• Set Flare Dispenser Mode (Lance-Leurres) to MARCHE (ON)
    -   step: 32. Test Autopilot system by flipping the PA test switch cover, setting switch to “M”, waiting for the green light and then setting the test switch back to “A” and closing the cover.
    -   step: 33. Test Fly-by-Wire system by flipping FBW test switch cover, setting switch to “C”, waiting for the green light, repeat for “L”, and then setting the test switch back to TEST and closing the cover.
    -   step: 34. Set PITOT HEAT switch FWD (ON) and set orange cover switch to SAFETY position (as shown). ANEMOmeter caution will extinguish.
    -   step: 35. Release Parking Brake (DOWN)
    -   step: 36. Engage DIRAV Nosewheel Steering – Press S<br />• DIRAV blue light means NWS is engaged
    -   step: 37. When INS alignment process is complete (see INS ALIGNMENT section), start taxiing.
