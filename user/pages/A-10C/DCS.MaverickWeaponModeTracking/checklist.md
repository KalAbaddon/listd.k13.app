checklist:
    -   step: 1. When the Maverick has locked on to a target, the Pointing Cross that represents the pointing angle of the Maverick in relation to the aircraft’s longitudinal axis will flash. 
    -   step: 2. At this point you can hold down the weapon release button to launch the missile. 
    -   step: If you have fired a Maverick from a LAU-88 launcher, the next Maverick on the launcher will automatically be selected and slewed to the last Maverick lock location.  This is termed a “Quick Draw”. 
    -   step: If however you wish to select a Maverick from another station, you must cycle your profile using the HUD rotary by pressing DMS Left or Right Short. 
    -   step: If you wish to re-cage the Maverick seeker to its boresight position or the seeker has reached its gimbal limits, you can re-cage the seeker to boresight by pressing China Hat Aft Short. 
    -   step: Using a Maverick in centroid track is best for moving vehicles or small, stationary targets.
