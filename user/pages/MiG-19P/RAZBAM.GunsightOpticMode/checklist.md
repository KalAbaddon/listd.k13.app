checklist:
    -   step: 1. In the ASP-5N Control Panel, put the Aiming Mode Switch in the Optic Position. This will remove the Radar Data from the ASP-5N and make it start to receive Target Wing Span and Distance Data that is manually introduced by the Pilot. 
    -   step: 2. For this example, an F-4 Phantom Fighter Aircraft, which has a Wingspan of 11 meters, is used as a Target. In this case, a value of 11 meters must be entered on the TARGET BASE/WING SPAN selector on the Sight. 
    -   step: 3. Uncage the Sight Gyro by turning the Cage/Uncage Lever. This allows the Aiming Reticle to move freely allowing Gunsight Gyro Precession.
    -   step: 4. Having selected the Target Wing Span, change the Aiming Reticle Distance by rotating the Throttle Handle backwards and forwards, check the change in the Diameter of the Outer Circle. 
    -   step: 5. The Distance introduced manually can be checked on the Target Distance Indicator to the left of the ASP-5N Sight.
    -   step: 6. When pursuing the target, rotate the Throttle Handle, so the wingtips of the Phantom touch the borders of the Outer Circle. This ensures the correct distance to target is introduced into the Sight. As the Distance to Target changes, this value can be adjusted, the Sight will calculate the Angular Velocity value and project an Aiming Solution. Open fire while maintaining the Center Dot over the Target. 
    -   step: NOTE - Keep in mind that in an Uncaged sight, the Reticle will move further down in an climbing maneuver as the introduced distance is increased. <br />During this process, as the Gunsight Gyros are Uncaged, it may be possible that during high G maneuvers, the reticle moves too far down, disappearing from the Sight Field of View. While this may not be an issue at Short Range, because Bullet deflection is not relevant, it may prevent effective engagement of Targets at Medium to Far Distances as in this case it will be impossible to introduce the correct Distance for a good Aiming Solution. <br />Standard solutions are to maintain the sight Caged until the Distance Measurement, then Uncage and Fire over the established aiming point, or use a Caged Sight and aim by the PilotÂ´s own predictions.<br />However, in the MiG-19, a Technical solution was provided for these cases - the ASP-5N Aiming Reticle dampening Button on the Control Stick. <br />This Button is an electrical Caging, Centering the Gunsight Reticle when pressed. This way, the Pilot can introduce the correct Distance into the Sight during intense maneuvering while the Lead Angle Calculations for the selected Distance are still made. When the button is released, the Reticle returns to the Calculated Impact Point Position (CIIP).

## ASP-5N Gunsight in Optical Mode

===

After completing the preceding steps, the Cannons are now ready to use. The ASP-5N gunsight is capable of being used as a Collimator-based Sight in which Target Span and Distance are introduced manually by the Pilot or can receive Distance Data from the RP-5 Radar, for a generally improved Aiming Solution, and for use in low visibility conditions.  However, Radar Malfunctions or Low Altitude Combat (due to Ground Clutter and the Radar tracking the Ground as a Target) can make the Radar ineffective and in these cases, the Optic method should be used.  The ASP-5N already has Bullet Flight Time, Bullet Path Curvature for Angular Speeds and Barometric Altitude Data for its calculations. The manual introduction of Distance by the Pilot is the last parameter needed to provide a Aiming Solution.
