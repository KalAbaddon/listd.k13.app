checklist:
    -   step: 1) Confirm that the “Battery” Switch, located on the RH Side Panel, is On.
    -   step: 2) On the LH Side Panel, Turn On <br />“Fuel Tank Pump 1”, <br />“Fuel Tank Pump 2”, <br />“Fuel Tank Pump 3” and <br />“Fuel Tank Pump 4”. <br />The Green Lamps “Fuel Tank 2” and “Fuel Tank 3, 4” adjacent to the Fuel Tank Pump Switches will turn Off.
    -   step: 3) On the LH Side Panel, Turn On “Flight Inst. & Cockpit Heating System” and “Anti-Skid System” switches.
    -   step: 4) On the LH Side Panel, Turn On the “Engine Start System” and “Fire Extinguisher System” switches.
    -   step: 5) On the LH Side Panel, Turn On both “Right Generator” and “Left Generator” Switches.
    -   step: 6) Put the Left Throttle into the “Idle” position.<br />WARNING Check that the Throttle is in the “Idle” position (resting on the “Stop” locks) when starting the Engine and not moved a little forward in between the Idle and Nominal positions to avoid a False Start or an excess of Fuel being dumped into the Combustion Chamber that can generate a Fire.
    -   step: 7) Press the Left Engine “Start” button for 2-3 seconds.<br />DURING THE ENGINE START CYCLE THE FOLLOWING MUST BE CHECKED<br /> The Engine EGT may reach 750oC during the start cycle but should stabilize under 650oC as Idle RPM is reached.<br />Engine EGT rise should not exceed a rate of 350 oC/second.<br />The “Oil” Warning Lamp should turn Off as soon as the engine reaches 4,000 RPM, but it could flash sometimes when the Engine is below 6,000 RPM. Above 6,000 RPM, the Warning Lamp should remain Off.<br />The “Left Generator Disconnected” Lamp, on the Main Instrument Panel, should turn Off when the Engine reaches Idle RPM.<br />The Main System Hydraulic Pressure Gauge, on the RH Side Horizontal Panel, should indicate 142 kg/cm2.<br />The “Low Pressure Hyd. System” Lamp, on the Main Instrument Panel, should turn Off.<br />The Engine should take no more than 80 seconds to reach Idle RPM.<br />Idle for the RD-9B engine is 4100 +200 RPM.<br />“Idle” speed is dependent on Outside Air Temperature. At -30oC the Engine Idle RPM should be not be less than 4,100 and above 30oC the RPM should not exceed 4,300.<br />WARNING If The “Oil” Lamp does not turn off when the Engine reaches Idle RPM, immediately move the Throttle to the “Stop” Position. If the Engine EGT remains above 750oC when the engine is at Idle, there are 2 Options<br />First, an excess of fuel in the combustion chamber may be causing the temperature to rise, so moving the throttle to the Nominal position may dump the fuel and the EGT should reduce below 650 oC. If the temperature does not reduce after 20 seconds, shut down the Engine.<br />Second, shut down the engine and inform the Ground Crew.
    -   step: 8) Once the LH Engine has reached Idle RPM, tell the ground crew to disconnect the External Ground Power.
    -   step: 9) Place the RH Engine Throttle into the “Idle” position.
    -   step: 10) Press the RH Engine “Start” button for 2-3 seconds.
    -   step: 11) Follow the same steps and checks as with the Left Engine. The Booster Hydraulic System Pressure located on the Main Instrument Panel should reach 142 kg/cm2.
    -   step: 12) Once both Engines have stabilized at Idle, connect both the Throttle Handles together using the Locking Mechanism.
    -   step: 13) The Engines should only remain at Idle RPM for less than 10 minutes. If you plan to stay at Idle RPM for longer, increase the Engine RPM to 10,000 RPM every 5-7 minutes. When the Ambient Temperature is below -5 oC, Engine operation below 9,000 RPM should be for as short as possible in order to avoid ice formation in the Compressor Stages.

## Engine Start

===

Only when Control Tower clearance is approved to start the engines

NOTE To make a Cranking start of the Engines, the corresponding
Engine Throttle is moved forward four degrees (4o) of the Idle
position where it makes a clicking sound indicating the activation of
the rotation start-up switch. Then operate the respective Engine
“Start” Button for 2 seconds, the Starter-Generator will accelerate
the Engine to 3,700-3,800 RPM for 30 seconds. This is useful after
false starts where fuel which has not been burnt in the Combustion
Chamber is expelled out the Jet Pipe in order to avoid an Engine Fire
on next Start.

The simultaneous starting of both Engines is not permitted by the Engine
Start System. Starting of the opposite Engine is only allowed after the
first Engine stabilizes at Idle RPM.

WARNING The Aircraft Starter-Generators allow for 5 consecutive Engine
starts followed by a 30-minute cooling period. Exceeding this limitation
can cause damage to the Starter-Generators.
