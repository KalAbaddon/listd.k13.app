checklist:
    -   step: 1) Ensure that all Gauge indications are correct, Control Boosters are selected On and the Stabilizer Mode Selector is set to Hydraulic Control, verify all System switches are set to the correct positions and the that the Cockpit is pressurized.
    -   step: 2) Check that the “ARU System in Take-Off and Landing Position” Lamp is illuminated.
    -   step: 3) Extend the Flaps to the 15o “Take-Off” position. The signal lamp “Flaps Deployed” will illuminate on the PPS-1 panel.
    -   step: 4) Check that the ASP-5N gunsight is in its “Caged” mode. Otherwise damage may occur to the sight mechanisms while taxiing due to the sensitivity of the Gyroscopes.
    -   step: 5) With Ground Crew assistance, ensure there are no other taxiing aircraft or obstacles nearby.
    -   step: 6) Disconnect the Nose Wheel Brake.
    -   step: 7) Increase the Engine Power settings to approximately 10,050 RPM.
    -   step: 8) As the Aircraft begins to move, operate the brake lever to check the Brakes for correct operation.
    -   step: 9) Release the brakes and start to taxi towards the designated Active Runway. Speed should be no more than 30 km/h.

    -   step: WARNING When more than one aircraft has been cleared to taxi to the Active Runway, maintain a separation distance between Aircraft of not less than 60 meters to avoid engine ingestion of debris and FOD dislodged from the ground by the jet efflux of the preceding aircraft.
    -   step: 10) Enter the Active Runway only when authorized and taxi straight for 10-15 meters to make sure the Aircraft is aligned with the center line.
    -   step: 11) Connect the “PVD Heat.” and “Emerg. TP-156” switches on the RH Side panel.<br />This will activate the heating of both Main and Standby Air Data Probes. This must be done on the runway and disconnected again immediately after landing to avoid Ground Crew injuries from contact with hot Air Data Probes.
