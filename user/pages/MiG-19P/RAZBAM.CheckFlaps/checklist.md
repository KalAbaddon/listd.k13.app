checklist:
    -   step: 1) Cycle through the Flap Positions. Check that the green “Flaps Deployed” indication on the PPS-1 panel illuminates when the flaps cycle through the Take-Off and Landing positions. A Ground Crew Technician will verify the position. Flaps should move symmetrically.
    -   step: 2) Extend and Retract the Airbrakes. Check that the Green “Airbrake Extended” signal on the PPS-1 panel illuminates when the Airbrakes are Extended. Main System Hydraulic pressure could fluctuate but should quickly return to 142 kg/cm2.
