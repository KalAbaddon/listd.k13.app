checklist:
    -   step: 1) The extension of the Airbrakes is allowed at all permissible airspeeds but may cause a slight vibration of the aircraft.
    -   step: 2) While flying at speeds above M = 1.2, the extension of the airbrakes may generate momentary Longitudinal Oscillations.
    -   step: 3) When flying at speeds close to the permissible limits, the following may happen<br />If rudder pedals begin to pulse, stop accelerating.<br />If the Aircraft starts to Oscillate about the Longitudinal Axis, decrease thrust and smoothly pitch up in to a climb to decrease the speed. Extension of the Airbrakes instance may cause an increase in the severity of the Oscillations.
    -   step: 4) The minimum indicated evolution speed is 350 km/h, at this speed the aircraft is stable and controllable.
    -   step: 5) During Training Circuits, Flights with the Landing Gear Extended or Retracted, maintain an IAS of 500 km/h.
    -   step: 6) Level Flight at Altitudes between 5,000 and 7,000 meters and with Afterburners engaged will require a considerable Nose Down Trim position.
    -   step: 7) When the Aircraft reaches Transonic Speeds in level flight, between M = 0.97-1.02, the Altimeter will display an increase in Altitude of about 600 meters and the Variometer might display as much as a 100 m/s climb. After the aircraft transits this speed zone, the Altimeter will decrease and display an Altitude about 100 meters above the actual and the Variometer will return to zero.
    -   step: 8) At Altitudes above 16,000m, the Throttles should not be moved below Military Power, or the Engines will shut down.
    -   step: 9) At altitudes from 14,000 to 16,000 meters, the Throttles should be moved slowly, taking a time of no less than 5 seconds to move from the Idle to Military Power positions.
    -   step: 10) Flight time under negative G Conditions must be limited to 10 seconds if the engines are operating in Military power or Afterburner, or 15 seconds in any other Engine Throttle Setting.
