checklist:
    -   step: DC Generator Failure is indicated by the illumination of the Generator Off Red Warning lights (ГЕНЕРАТОР ВЫКЛЮЧЕН) on the Main Instrument Panel. 
    -   step: If both DC Generators fail at the same time, the V-1 Voltmeter, located on the Main Instrument Panel, will display approximately 24V indicating the Battery is now powering the DC Busses.
    -   step: If a single DC Generator fails, the power generated by the remaining one is capable of powering all the Aircraft electrical power consumers.
