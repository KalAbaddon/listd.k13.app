checklist:
    -   step: 1. Put the RP-5 Altitude Mode Switch in the 1 Position. 
    -   step: 2. This turns off the AR-18-1 Search Antenna of the Radar and any Target within 1,200 meters of the Aircraft will be Locked. The Radar will then work identically to a Radio Range-Finder, like the one installed in the MiG-19S. 
    -   step: 3. The process to attack is identical - as the Distance is being introduced automatically into the Gunsight, you only need to place the Reticle Center Dot over the Target and fire.

For the RP-5 a special mode was introduced to deal with this situation and aid in the aiming process in Altitudes as low as 900-1,000 meters. This is done by turning off the AR-18-1 Search Antenna and reducing the AR-18-16 Antenna Tracking Range to 1,200 meters. To use this mode, you need to do the following:
