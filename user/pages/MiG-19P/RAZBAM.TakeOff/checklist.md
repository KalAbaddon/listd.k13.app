checklist:
    -   step: 1) Connect the Nose Wheel Brake.
    -   step: 2) Remove the Landing Gear Lever Lock.
    -   step: 3) Operate the Brakes and increase the Throttles to 9,000-10,000 RPM.
    -   step: 4) Release the Brakes and start increasing the Throttle Setting to Military Power Setting or to Afterburner Setting as necessary.<br />When taking off from a concrete runway at the Military Power Setting and the Flaps in the 15o Take-Off Position, the take-off run will be around 600-650 meters.*<br />When taking off from a concrete runway at the Afterburner Setting with no Flaps deployed, the take-off run is reduced to around 515-520 meters.*<br />* For a clean aircraft<br />NOTE When taking off with 760-liter drop tanks, the take-off run increases by 250 meters.
    -   step: 5) Maintain the Control Stick in the Neutral Position at the beginning of the take-off run. Correct any initial yaw by applying differential braking. As the IAS increases, the Rudder becomes effective to correct any Yawing motion.
    -   step: 6) During the take-off run, the aircraft has no inherent tendency to Ground-Loop. A crosswind of 15 m/s at a 90o angle does not considerably affect the take-off run.
    -   step: 7) As the speed reaches 200 km/h, move the Control Stick backwards to about 2/3 of its travel.
    -   step: 8) At a speed between 230 and 250 km/h, the aircraft will gradually lift the nose wheel off the ground. The pilot needs only to maintain the upper contour of the nose projected against the natural horizon.
    -   step: NOTE When taking off in Afterburner, the Control Stick should be moved slightly more backward than in Military Power to lift the Nose Wheel.
    -   step: 9) The aircraft will easily come off the ground at a speed of 280 +20 km/h with no tendency to ballooning or stalling.
    -   step: 10) In the air, the Armored Windshield will hamper judging the distance from the ground, so use the left side of the Canopy to observe the ground.
    -   step: 11) Retract the landing gear at an altitude of 15 meters. The Landing Gear should be retracted below a speed of 550 km/h, in excess of this speed the retraction process will be too slow, or the Landing Gear may fail to retract. Normal retraction time must be less than 8 seconds.
    -   step: 12) Check the Retraction of the Landing Gear by the three illuminated Red lights and the “Retract Gear” signal going Off on the PPS-1 Panel. The Pilot can also check the three Mechanical Indicators in the upper part of the wing for the Main Landing Gear and to the Left of the Canopy for the Nose Landing Gear.
    -   step: 13) Move the Landing Gear Selector Lever to the Neutral position.
    -   step: 14) Retract the flaps at an altitude of 100 meters after the Landing Gear has been retracted. With flaps at the 15o position, the aircraft will be a little tail heavy. At the start of the retraction, the Pilot will hardly feel the aircraft sinking.<br />WARNING With flaps in 15o, the aircraft should not exceed an IAS of 800 km/h.
    -   step: 15) If one of the afterburners fails, indicated by the “AB” Green Lamp Off and an associated EGT below 500 oC, the Aircraft will Yaw towards the failed afterburner engine. However, this should not complicate the take-off run. The tendency to Yaw to this side should be counteracted with Rudder and differential braking. Once in the airborne, circle the Airbase and land immediately.
    -   step: 16) If one of the Red Landing Gear Position indication lights on the PPS-1 fails to illuminate, disconnect the Afterburner and repeat the Extension and Retraction process while maintaining a speed below 500 km/h. If the light still fails to illuminate, return and land immediately.
