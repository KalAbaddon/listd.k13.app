    -   step: 1) At Altitudes above 2,000 meters, the UVPD-15 Cockpit Altitude & Differential Pressure Dual Instrument must show a Cockpit Differential Pressure of about 0.28-0.32 kg/cm2. As the Altitude increases above 8,000 meters, the cockpit pressure should be no less than 0.24 kg/cm2.<br />Cockpit Altitude must be the same as the Altimeter up to 4,000 meters, when it should increase at half the speed of the Altimeter reaching a maximum value of 12,000 meters at the Aircraft Service Ceiling.

    -   step: 2) If the Canopy freezes while descending from High Altitudes, check the following<br />Check that the Cockpit Air Supply Lever is Open.<br />Check that the Canopy is Pressurized.<br />Select the Cockpit Temperature Switch to “Hot” and increase the Engine RPM.
