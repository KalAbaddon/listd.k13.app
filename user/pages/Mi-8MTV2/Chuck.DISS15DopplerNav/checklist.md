    -   step: 6. Set your LATERAL DRIFT (km) to 0 using the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. 
    -   step: 7. Set your DISTANCE (km) to either 0 (if you want to have a counter of the distance you travelled so far) or to the distance you want to travel using the “H” (AFT) button (if you want to have a counter that tells you how close you are to your waypoint). 
    -   step: 8. Set your HEADING ANGLE (degrees) to 330 deg & 0 minute. 
    -   step: 9. Set DopplerSystem to ON to tell the system to take your currentlocation as your reference point.
