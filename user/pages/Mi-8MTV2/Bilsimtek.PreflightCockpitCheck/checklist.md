    -   step: Set the pressure altimeter pointers to zero and check the barometric pressure display for compliance with the actual aerodrome pressure with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm Hg [LShift] + [B] / [LCtrl] + [B]

    -   step: release the rotor brake [RCtrl] + [R] (down)
    -   step: make sure the collective pitch control lever is at the lower stop [Num –] and the throttle control twist grip is turned fully to the left [PgDn], the engines throttle levers are set in the neutral detent [RCTRL] + [HOME / RCTRL] + [END], the control stick is in a position close to neutral and the fuel shutoff levers are in the aft (closed) position [ RCtrl] + [PageUp..
