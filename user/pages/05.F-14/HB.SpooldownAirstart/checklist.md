## Spooldown Airstart

===

### The spooldown airstart can be attemped immediately after engine loss before significant spooldown has occured. This is the fastest way to restart an engine.

### Depending on engine RPM it might take up to 10 seconds to notice any RPM increase and up to 90 seconds to reach commanded RPM. If the engine mode selected by the AFTC was PRI, a renewed attempt may be made in SEC.
