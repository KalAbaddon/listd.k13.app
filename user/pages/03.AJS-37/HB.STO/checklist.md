checklist:
    -   step: To achieve the shortest possible take-off distance, Zone 3 afterburner should be used. 
    -   step: Note- With Zone 3 afterburner, the aircraft accelerates very quickly and may result in reaching maximum allowed airspeed with extended landing gear before it has fully retracted.
