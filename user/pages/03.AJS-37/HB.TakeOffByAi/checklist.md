checklist:
    -   step: 1. Apply brakes 
    -   step: 2. Advance throttle to maximum power without afterburner. 
        details: Check EGT (max 590°C + outside ambient temperature) 
    -   step: 3. Release brakes, steer with pedals 
    -   step: 4. If needed, ignite afterburner. 
        details: Check- <br />a. Zone indicator = desired afterburner zone. <br />b. Exhaust nozzle indicator = desired zone achieved. <br />c. Pressure ratio (EPR)- <br />-Zone 2 <br />---» < +15°C  > 1.9  <br />---» > +15°C  > 1.8 <br />-Zone 3 =  Maximum power
    -   step: 5. Rotate 
        details: • At 280 km/h to a 10° climb attitude when using maximum power without afterburner <br />• At 250 km/h to a 13° climb attitude when using afterburner 
    -   step: 6. Retract the landing gear when airborne. 
    -   step: 7. Elevate HUD reflector glass to inflight mode to display HUD symbology when at lower angles of attack. 
    -   step: Note- There is a risk of a slight decrease in lift as the flaps retract when retracting the landing gear.
