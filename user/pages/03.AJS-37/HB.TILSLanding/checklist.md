checklist:
    -   step: 1. Set landing base as destination. Press L MÅL. 
    -   step: 2. Set QFE pressure on altimeter 
    -   step: 3. Select runway heading (cycle runway heading, BANA/ UT (OUT) and press LS) 
    -   step: 4. Set master mode LANDN NAV about 30 km away from the destination 
    -   step: 5. Set Autothrottle ON if desired. Autopilot mode SPAK ON. 
    -   step: 6. Follow steering commands on the HUD or ADI 
    -   step: 7. If using TILS to land, check that TILS is locked (TILS light lit) and used after the LB turn is complete. If using a short approach set master mode to LANDN P/O and then return the master mode selector to LANDN NAV in order to select the touchdown point LF as destination.
