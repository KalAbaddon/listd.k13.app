checklist:
    -   step: 1. Determine target altitude using the F10 map (in our case 0 ft). Add target elevation to your dive bombing table altitude parameters in the table below. 
    -   step: 2. Set gunsight depression to approx. 80 mil using the DEPR knob 
    -   step: 3. Set gunsight mode to MANUAL 
    -   step: 4. Power on armament pylons with the bombs you want to drop. 
    -   step: 5. Arm bomb fuses (NOSE & TAIL recommended) 
    -   step: 6. Select external store release (BOMB for single bomb release or RIPL for ripple bomb release) 
    -   step: 7. If RIPL selected, set desired bomb release interval 
    -   step: 8. For a 30 deg bomb run dive, initiate dive from 6000 ft at 350 kts. 
    -   step: 9. Use your altimeter, speed indicator and attitude indicator to fly with correct bombing parameters. For a 30 deg dive, maintain airspeed between 440 and 450 kts. 
    -   step: 10. Release bombs at 2000 ft above ground level by holding the WEAPON RELEASE BUTTON (Ralt+Space).
