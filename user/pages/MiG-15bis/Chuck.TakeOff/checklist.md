checklist:
    -   step: 1. Line up on the runway using your wheel brake lever and rudder pedals to steer the aircraft.
    -   step: 2. Make sure your flaps are up and your airbrakes are retracted. If you have a short runway, you can use 20 degrees of flaps.
    -   step: 3. Hold wheel brake lever and throttle up to 80009000 RPM.
    -   step: 4. Release brake and throttle up to Maximum RPM.
    -   step: 5. From 0 to 80 km/h, use your brake and rudder pedals to steer the aircraft. Your rudder alone is ineffective at these low speeds. Use your rudder to steer once you reach 80 km/h or higher.
    -   step: 6. Pull your stick slightly back when you reach 180190 km/h to gently lift the nosewheel.
    -   step: 7. Rotate at 220-230 km/h. Take special care not to pull too hard on the stick on you will stall, crash and burn.
    -   step: 8. Set your landing gear lever UP, wait for the indicator lights to go from green to red, then set the landing gear leverto NEUTRAL.
    -   step: 9. Once airborne, make sure your flaps are retracted (if they were deployed) and set the flaps lever to NEUTRAL. Failing to do so will keep consuming air pressure and can cause you issues if all available air pressure is expended during the flight.
    -   step: 10. Maintain a vertical speed of around 7 to 8 m/s initially. Recommended climb speed is 500 km/h.
