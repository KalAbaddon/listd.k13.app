checklist:
    -   step: 1. Deploy airbrakes and line up on the runway. Confirm that the Airbrake light illuminates
    -   step: 2. Reduce airspeed to 400-450 km/h.
    -   step: 3. Deploy flaps to 20 deg and deploy landing gear once you reach 320-350 km/h. Wait for 2-3 seconds, then set flaps lever to 55 deg.
    -   step: 4. Confirm that the Flaps light is illuminated, and that the Landing Gear indicator lights are green. Confirm flaps and landing gear deployment by checking the flaps, main gear and nose gear pins on the wing and aircraft nose.
    -   step: 5. Final approach is at 250-270 km/h.
    -   step: 6. Set engine power around 7000-9000 RPM. Avoid reducing power below 6000 RPM and keep your airspeed higher than 200 km/h at all times during the approach. This will reduce the risk of inducing a nasty stall.
    -   step: 7. With a speed of 260-270 km/h (engine RPM at least 6000, descent rate of 7-8 m/s), glide to the beginning of the landing flare.
    -   step: 8. At an altitude of 6-7 m, slightly pull back the stick to start decreasing the descent rate in such a way that the aircraft stops descending at an altitude of not more than 1 m. During the flare, decrease engine RPM to the minimum and maintain constant pitch and roll.
    -   step: 9. Touchdown speed is 200-220 km/h.
    -   step: 10. During the flare, speed gradually decreases to 180-200 km/h. As the speed decreases, the pilot increases pitch by pulling the stick towards him and thus deflecting the elevators upwards to keep the lift force counteracting the aircraftâ€™s weight constant. The airplane gradually and smoothly descends from 1 m altitude to touchdown.
    -   step: 11. Set throttle to IDLE after touchdown.
    -   step: 12. Gently press the wheel brake lever to slow down.
    -   step: 13. Once runway is cleared, retract flaps and airbrakes. Taxi to parking area, then perform aircraft shutdown.
