checklist:
    -   step: 1. Equip SPRD-99 rockets on pylon 6 (this is usually where you have your ASO-2 pod for your chaff and flares) and do the same start-up procedure we did previously.
    -   step: 2. When you are lined up on the runway, make sure JATO (SPRD) START & JETTISON switches are set to ON (FWD)
    -   step: 3. Throttle up to full power (with full afterburners).
    -   step: 4. When you reach 120-150 km/h, the rockets will ignite automatically and give you a significant thrust increase during 7 seconds.
    -   step: 5. When you are up, you can jettison the rockets by flipping up the red countermeasure switch cover and hold the countermeasure switch during 1 second.
    -   step: 6. Raise landing gear and flaps as seen previously in normal takeoff procedure.
    -   step: 7. You may now buy a pair of newunderwear.
