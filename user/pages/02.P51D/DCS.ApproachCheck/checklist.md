checklist:
    -   step: Fuel – select fullest internal tank for landing.
    -   step: Fuel booster pump – set to ON. 
    -   step: Mixture control – set to RUN (AUTO RICH on earlier aircraft).
    -   step: Carburetor ram- and hot-air control levers – as required.
    -   step: Oil and coolant radiator air control switches – set to AUTOMATIC.
    -   step: Clean out the engine at 3000 RPM and 61 in.Hg for 1 minute.
    -   step: Prop control – forward to 2700 RPM.
    -   step: Landing gear – move lever to DOWN. Check indicator to see that the gear is down and locked. Note, the gear should be lowered at 170 mph or less.
    -   step: Flaps – full down. Note, flaps are usually lowered for the turn to final approach.
    -   step: Shoulder harness – lock harness and check by leaning forward against it. 
    -   step: The traffic pattern used may vary depending on the airfield and local conditions. Regardless of the traffic pattern used, keep the pattern in close enough to the field and at sufficient altitude so as to bring the aircraft in safely even with the power off if necessary. 
    -   step: In preparing to peel off, control your airspeed. The greater the speed, the longer it takes to slow down. Peel off should be performed at speeds no greater than 200-225 mph.
