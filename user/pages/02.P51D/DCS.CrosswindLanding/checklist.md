checklist:
    -   step: Maintain airspeeds slightly higher than for a normal approach.
    -   step: Drop the wing into the wind slightly to counteract the drift, and keep the plane straight with the runway.
    -   step: Just before touching down, level the wings.
    -   step: Be sure to keep the stick back after touch down so that the tail wheel will remain locked.
    -   step: Make a wheel landing if the crosswind is excessive, gusty, strong, or otherwise doubtful. Use approximately half flaps for any appreciable crosswind. 
    -   step: If crabbing is required during the approach, be sure to straighten out before landing. Never land in a crab as it is very stressful on the landing gear.
