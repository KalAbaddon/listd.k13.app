checklist:
    -   step: Be sure takeoff area is clear and check final approach for inbound aircraft.
    -   step: Release brakes and line up for takeoff.
    -   step: Advance throttle smoothly and steadily to Takeoff Power (61 in.Hg MP at 3000 RPM).
    -   step: Do not attempt to lift the tail too soon as this increases directional instability. Pushing the stick forward unlocks the tail wheel, thereby making steering difficult. The best takeoff procedure is to hold the tail down until sufficient speed for rudder control is attained and then to allow the tail to rise slowly. Some rudder input may be necessary to maintain heading as the tail is lifted and stabilized in a takeoff attitude.
    -   step: It is recommended that 61 in.Hg and 3000 RPM be used for takeoffs and that this power setting is reached as quickly as possible after the takeoff run is started. However, advance the throttle smoothly and never jam it forward. Torque effects appearing from a sudden onset of power can lead to a loss of directional control of the aircraft. 
    -   step: When a formation takeoff is performed, a lower power setting of 55 in.Hg may be used to allow the wingmen room for increased power over the leader in order to maintain their position. 
    -   step: If rough engine occurs during the takeoff run, immediately throttle back 4 or 5 in.Hg manifold pressure to complete the takeoff if conditions permit. Throttling back tends to decrease the intensity of detonation or preignition and minimizes the chances of engine failure. If this condition occurs on takeoff, the spark plugs must be changed before the next flight.
    -   step: Avoid sudden bursts of power during takeoff! Make it smooth and steady.
