checklist:
    -   step: Before descent, turn the windshield defroster control knob ON. Descent may be carried out at any safe speed down to the recommended margin of about 25 percent above stalling speed. With the landing gear and flaps up, the glide is fairly flat with the nose high. Forward visibility is poor in this condition, and in traffic areas, a series of "S- turns‚Äù should be employed to prevent a possible collision. Lowering either the flaps or landing gear, or both, greatly increases the gliding angle and the rate of descent.
