checklist:
    -   step: Advance the throttle quickly but smoothly to a manifold pressure of 46” at 2700 RPM. Avoid a sudden rush of power to prevent a possible loss of control due to increasing torque effects.
    -   step: As power is increased, counteract left torque by using right rudder and right trim tab.
    -   step: Raise the landing gear.
    -   step: Trim the aircraft to relieve the elevator pressure.
    -   step: After your IAS reaches 120 mph and altitude reaches 500 feet, raise the flaps. Bring them up gradually, about 10° at a time. Monitor the change in attitude as the flaps are raised.
    -   step: Set oil and coolant radiator flaps as necessary for continued flight. 
    -   step: Do not make sudden and large throttle movements. Use all of the controls smoothly to avoid a loss of control.
    -   step: If the aircraft has been trimmed for landing, it may take considerable stick-forward pressure to maintain the nose down until the elevator is re-trimmed. 
    -   step: It’s critical to maintain a straight course until enough airspeed is gained to raise the flaps and begin maneuvering.
