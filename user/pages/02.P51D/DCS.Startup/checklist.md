checklist:
    -   step: Prime the engine three to four seconds if it is cold, one if warm.
    -   step: Raise the starter switch cover and hold the switch up in the START position to operate the starter and begin turning the engine ([Home] key).
    -   step: After six propeller blades have passed the canopy, set the Ignition switch to BOTH while continuing to operate the starter.
    -   step: As the engine starts, move the mixture control to RUN and release the starter switch. If the engine fails to take hold after several revolutions, give it one second’s more prime. 
    -   step: If the engine cuts out after starting, return the mixture control immediately to IDLE CUTOFF. 
    -   step: Check that oil pressure reaches at least 50 PSI within 30 seconds. If it doesn’t, stop the engine.
    -   step: Idle at about 1200-1300 RPM until the oil temperature reaches 40°C and the oil pressure is steady.
    -   step: Check the suction gauge to show between 3.75 to 4.25” of vacuum pressure.
    -   step: Check all of the engine instruments. Make sure they don’t exceed or fall below their limits.
    -   step: After the engine is warmed up, idle at 1000 RPM or slightly less. This keeps the engine clean but not too hot. 
    -   step: If for any reason you anticipate pulling more than 40” of manifold during the engine ground run, be sure that the airplane is anchored.
