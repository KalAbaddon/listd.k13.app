checklist:
    -   step: To accomplish a minimum-run takeoff, lower flaps to 15 - 20Â°. Keep the aircraft in a three-point attitude and allow it to fly itself off the ground in this position. As soon as airborne, allow airspeed to build up and climb out when speed exceeds 100 mph. Retract landing gear when airspeed reaches a safe value. Raise flaps above 200 feet altitude.
