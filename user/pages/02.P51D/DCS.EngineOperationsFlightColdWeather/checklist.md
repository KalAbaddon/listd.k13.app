checklist:
    -   step: Use carburetor heat as required to improve fuel vaporization and combat carburetor icing, but do not use carburetor heat above 12,000 feet as resultant excessively lean mixtures will cause engine roughness due to the effect of heat on the altitude compensator of the carburetor. 
    -   step: Because of the constant-speed propeller and the automatic manifold pressure regulator, it is difficult to detect carburetor ice formation except by irregular engine operation.
