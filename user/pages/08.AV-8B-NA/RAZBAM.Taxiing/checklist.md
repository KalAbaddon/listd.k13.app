    -   step: WARNING
        details: Idle thrust is high and will result in excessive taxi speed unless the brakes are used or nozzles deflected. The use of nozzle deflection between 45o and 60o for control of taxi speed is recommended. <br />When taxiing with nozzles deflected, it is essential that the stick be held forward 2o nose down so that the nose RCS valve will remain closed. This will prevent the nose RCS valve from blowing debris into the engine intake ducts.

## Taxiing 

===

 Aircraft directional control during taxi should be via nosewheel steering since no differential braking is available.
