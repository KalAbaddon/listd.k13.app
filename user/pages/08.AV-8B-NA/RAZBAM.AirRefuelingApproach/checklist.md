checklist:
    -   step: 1. Complete the before plug-in checklist. 
    -   step: 2. Assume a position 10 to 15 feet in trail of the drogue. 
    -   step: 3. Keep the refueling probe in both the horizontal and vertical reference planes. 
    -   step: 4. Trim the aircraft to keep this stabilized approach. 
    -   step: 5. Select the drogue as the primary reference point on the tanker. 
    -   step: 6. Set the power to establish an optimum 3 to 5 knots closure rate on the drogue. 
    -   step: 7. Small corrections in the approach phase are acceptable<br />a. Small lateral corrections are made with the rudder. <br />b. Small vertical corrections are made with the stabilator. <br />c. Avoid corrections in the longitudinal axis. They cause probe displacement in both the lateral and vertical reference planes. 
    -   step: 8. If alignment is off in the final phase abort and do over.

## Air Refueling Approach

===

Refueling altitudes and airspeeds are dictat3ed by receiver and/or tanker characteristics and operational needs. This covers a practical spectrum, from the deck to 35,000 feet and 190 to 300 knots.
