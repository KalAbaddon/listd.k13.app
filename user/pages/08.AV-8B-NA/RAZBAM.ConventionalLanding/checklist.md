## Conventional Landing (CL) 

===

The CL requires substantially greater distance to stop than a SL or RVL. Landing distance available is a critical consideration when performing a CL. The brakes are designed primarily for V/STOL and are marginal for a CL without Power Nozzle Braking (PNB); therefore, always use PNB when performing a CL. CLs without using PNB is an emergency procedure only.
