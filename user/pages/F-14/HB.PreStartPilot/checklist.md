checklist:
    -   step: Check AIR SOURCE switch is set to OFF.
        details: 
    -   step: Set HYD TRANSFER PUMP switch to OFF. (Guard up)
    -   step: EMERG FLT HYD switch to LOW,
        details: Check for ON flag in EMER FLT LOW hydraulic pressure window.<br />Verify control over horizontal<br />and rudder control surfaces on surface position indicator. 
    -   step: EMERG FLT HYD switch to HIGH,
        details: Check for ON flag in EMER FLT HI hydraulic pressure window.<br />Verify control over horizontal<br />and rudder control surfaces on surface position indicator.<br />Should have a higher deflection rate than LOW.
    -   step: EMERG FLT HYD switch to AUTO(LOW),
        details: Check for OFF flags in both EMER FLT LOW and HI. 
    -   step: ENG CRANK switch to R (Right engine).
        details: Check for oil and hydraulic pressure at roughly 20% RPM.<br />Check START/VALVE caution light indication.<br />Switch is held in position automatically by solenoid<br />until engine is at roughly 50% RPM.
    -   step: Right throttle to IDLE at 20% RPM.
        details: Will automatically actuate ignition system and fuel flow.<br />Light off (EGT temperature rise) should occur within 5-15 secs.<br />EGT temperature should peak around 40-50% and not exceed 890 째C<br />which constitutes a hot start.
    -   step: Check ENG CRANK switch returns to OFF around 50% rpm
        details: and START/VALVE caution light turns off.<br />If ENG CRANK stays at R manually set it to off before 60% rpm.<br />If START/VALVE caution light is still on, disconnect starter air.
    -   step: Check R GEN caution light turns off.
        details: At around 59% rpm.
    -   step: Check R FUEL PRESS caution light turns off.
        details: Before idle rpm.
    -   step: Check engine idle instrument readings.
        details: RPM - 62 to 78%.<br />EGT - 500 째C (nominal).<br />FF - 950 to 1400 Pph (nominal).<br />NOZ position - 100%.<br />OIL - 25 to 35 psi <br />nominal, 15 minimum).<br />FLT HYD PRESS - 3000 psi. 
    -   step: Order plane captain to disconnect external electrical power. 
    -   step: ENG CRANK switch to L (Left engine).
        details: When combined hydraulic pressure reaches 3000 psi switch ENG CRANK back to OFF. 
    -   step: HYD TRANSFER PUMP switch to NORMAL.
        details: If it does not pressurize combined side within 10 secs,<br />immediately set HYD TRANSFER PUMP switch to SHUTOFF.<br />Will operate from flight side to maintain<br />combined side at between 2400-2600 psi.
    -   step: HYD TRANSFER PUMP switch to SHUTOFF. 
    -   step: ENG CRANK switch to L (Left engine).
        details: Check for oil and hydraulic pressure at roughly 20% RPM.<br />Check START/VALVE caution light indication.<br />Switch is held in position automatically by solenoid<br />until engine is at roughly 50% RPM.
    -   step: Left throttle to IDLE at 20% RPM.
        details: Will automatically actuate ignition system and fuel flow.<br />Light off (EGT temperature rise) should occur within 5-15 secs.<br />EGT temperature should peak around 40-50% and not exceed 890 째C<br />which constitutes a hot start.
    -   step: Check ENG CRANK switch returns to OFF around 50% rpm
        details: and START/VALVE caution light turns off.<br />If ENG CRANK stays at L manually set it to off before 60% rpm.<br />If START/VALVE caution light is still on, disconnect starter air.
    -   step: Check L GEN caution light turns off.
        details: At around 59% rpm.
    -   step: Check L FUEL PRESS caution light turns off.
        details: Before idle rpm.
    -   step: Check engine idle instrument readings.
        details: RPM - 62 to 78%.<br />EGT - 500 째C (nominal).<br />FF - 950 to 1400 Pph (nominal).<br />NOZ position - 100%.<br />OIL - 25 to 35 psi (nominal, 15 minimum).<br />FLT HYD PRESS - 3000 psi. 
    -   step: Order plane captain to disconnect starter air. 
    -   step: Cycle AIR SOURCE switch to L ENG, R ENG, then set it to BOTH ENG.
        details: Verify cockpit airflow at all positions.
    -   step: HYD TRANSFER PUMP switch to NORMAL.
