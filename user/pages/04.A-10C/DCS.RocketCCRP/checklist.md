checklist:
    -   step: Once the target is set as SPI, select a rocket profile and set the master mode to CCRP. 
    -   step: Upon doing so, a vertical Azimuth Steering Line (ASL) will be drawn on the HUD along the heading to the SPI. A short distance from the top of the ASL is a small circle with a dot inside called the Solution Cue. 
    -   step: Also on the HUD will be the rocket reticle, but unlike CCIP mode, there will be no range numeric or analog bar.
    -   step: To aim and fire rockets, you must fly the aircraft to place the rocket reticle pipper inside the small Solution Cue.  In doing so, you align the aircraft along the proper heading and attitude to launch rockets for impact at the SPI location. 
    -   step: Note that this can happen quickly and you may need to launch several rockets in a short time before you can no longer keep the pipper in the Solution Cue. 
    -   step: The advantage of rocket CCRP delivery is that you can engage from further way while in level flight or even pitched-up to loft rockets.  
    -   step: The disadvantage is that it can be much less accurate than CCIP delivery.  You would generally use CCRP mode against a heavily defended target in order to suppress it

## Rocket CCRP Use 

===

CCRP rocket delivery mode allows you to launch rockets in reference to the SPI and can be done from level flight or even a lofting delivery.  Before using this mode, you will first need to designate the intended target as the SPI.  This could be done with the TDC, TAD, Maverick, Gun pipper or TGP.
